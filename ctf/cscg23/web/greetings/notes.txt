Admin username: administrator
=> but administrator doesn't seem to be active - he is not visiting the greetings

AuffÃ¤llig:
- XSS on message payload
- staff/admin users are marked with "0x1"
- in login.php something is outcommented //session_destroy(); //session_start();
- POST /admin/manage_admins.php
=> in implementation an "exit" is missing
=> you can upgrade a user to an admin
=> watch the flag in the /admin/view_greetings.php
==> forge post request with correct contenttype header and mode and target_username attributes
- in beiden view_greetings wird kein php "trim" verwendet um den username zu validieren

Encoded administrator pw:
